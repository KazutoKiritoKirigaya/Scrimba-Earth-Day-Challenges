# My Solution to Scrimba's Earth Day Challenge 2

## Task:

### Wire up the `<select>` tag and recycle button so that an emoji of the selected item appears in the DOM each time the recycle button is pressed.

### Stretch Goal 1️⃣ Add an item limit to indicate when the recycle bin is full

### Stretch Goal 2️⃣: Add the option to empty the bin.

### Stretch Goal 3️⃣: Animate adding the items to the bin.

Quick start:

```
$ yarn # npm install
$ yarn build # npm run build
```

## Development

Run Webpack in watch-mode to continually compile the JavaScript as you work:

```
$ yarn watch # npm run watch
```

## Supporting Scrimba

Since 2017, we have created over 20 free courses on Scrimba, and we're going to
continue launching free courses. But to pay our bills, we have to charge once
in a while. So if you've ever wanted to "give back" to Scrimba, you can do that by buying
one of our paid courses

-   [Become a professional React developer](https://scrimba.com/course/greact)
-   [The Responsive Web Design Bootcamp](https://scrimba.com/course/gresponsive)
-   [The Ultimate JavaScript Bootcamp](https://scrimba.com/course/gjavascript)

    It would also mean the world to us if you share the courses.

Happy Coding!
