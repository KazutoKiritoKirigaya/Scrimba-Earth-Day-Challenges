# My Solution to Scrimba's Earth Day Challenge 4

## Task:

### Part 1: Add validation to check that the name and email fields are filled in and display a warning message if not (you might not need JS for this üòú).

### Part 2: Hide the form and show a thank you message on submit.

### Stretch Goal 1Ô∏è‚É£: Add warning styling if the name and email fields are empty (you might not need JS for this either)

### Stretch Goal 2Ô∏è‚É£: Personalise the thank you message with the user's name.

### Stretch Goal 3Ô∏è‚É£: Disable the button when no checkboxes are checked.

Quick start:

```
$ yarn # npm install
$ yarn build # npm run build
```

## Development

Run Webpack in watch-mode to continually compile the JavaScript as you work:

```
$ yarn watch # npm run watch
```

## Supporting Scrimba

Since 2017, we have created over 20 free courses on Scrimba, and we're going to
continue launching free courses. But to pay our bills, we have to charge once
in a while. So if you've ever wanted to "give back" to Scrimba, you can do that by buying
one of our paid courses

-   [Become a professional React developer](https://scrimba.com/course/greact)
-   [The Responsive Web Design Bootcamp](https://scrimba.com/course/gresponsive)
-   [The Ultimate JavaScript Bootcamp](https://scrimba.com/course/gjavascript)

    It would also mean the world to us if you share the courses.

Happy Coding!
