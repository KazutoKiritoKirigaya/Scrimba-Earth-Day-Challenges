# My Solution to Scrimba's Earth Day Challenge 3

## Task:

### For each action in actionsArr, render a button on the page which matches the design on the slide.

### The button should show:

### 1. The Emoji.

### 2. The action name.

### 3. Add +5 points to the user’s score for good actions, and -5 for bad actions on click.

### 4. Update the points total in the DOM on click.

### Stretch Goal 1️⃣: Change each button color, green for good activities, red for bad.

### Stretch Goal 2️⃣: Change the background color to reflect the user's total points. 0 or above = green, below 0 = red.

### Stretch Goal 3️⃣: Add an activity count.

Quick start:

```
$ yarn # npm install
$ yarn build # npm run build
```

## Development

Run Webpack in watch-mode to continually compile the JavaScript as you work:

```
$ yarn watch # npm run watch
```
