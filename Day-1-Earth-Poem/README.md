# My Solution to Scrimba's Earth Day Challenge 1

## Task:

### Task: Changing only the code ABOVE (lines 1-15), complete the poem and render it on the page.

### Stretch Goal 1️⃣: Render the most suitable emoji from the emojis array in the object somewhere in our poem.

### Stretch Goal 2️⃣: Without changing the object declaration above, change sea color to purple!

### Stretch Goal 3️⃣: Without changing the CSS file, style the values added from the object.

### **Poem: Forests are green, oceans are blue. Keep the earth clean, for me and for you!**

Quick start:

```
$ yarn # npm install
$ yarn build # npm run build
```

## Development

Run Webpack in watch-mode to continually compile the JavaScript as you work:

```
$ yarn watch # npm run watch
```

## Supporting Scrimba

Since 2017, we have created over 20 free courses on Scrimba, and we're going to
continue launching free courses. But to pay our bills, we have to charge once
in a while. So if you've ever wanted to "give back" to Scrimba, you can do that by buying
one of our paid courses

-   [The Responsive Web Design Bootcamp](https://scrimba.com/course/gresponsive)
-   [The Ultimate JavaScript Bootcamp](https://scrimba.com/course/gjavascript)

    It would also mean the world to us if you share the courses.
